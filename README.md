## What it contains:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Fundamental Katas *Solutions*. Code Wars is a great tool for learning & solving problems in different ways.

## Optimizations

Gotta upload some Python and come back to those challenges that were a bit harder...

## Lessons Learned:

I always see incredible solutions I could have never come up with, and I always add them to my Anki deck.
**DO NOT COPY/PASTE THE SOLUTIONS! Codewars is not meant for that.... DO SOME GOOGLE-FU & and find the answers yourself =)
